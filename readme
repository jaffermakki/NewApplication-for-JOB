# Job Copilot (Single-file)


A personal Job Copilot app (Simplify-like) — single-file Node server that serves a React + Tailwind SPA and provides backend APIs for auth, applications, resume scoring, a live jobboard (SSE), and auto-apply (safe flow).


> This repo is meant for **personal use / prototyping**. It uses file-based JSON storage (`users.json`, `applications.json`, `jobboard.json`). Do not run this as-is in a public production environment without applying security hardening.
